										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why Puzzle Parking Systems Are the Ideal Solution for Commercial Spaces</strong></p>
<p>As urban India becomes denser and the cost of land in commercial zones skyrockets, the demand for intelligent, space-saving parking solutions has never been more urgent. Shopping malls, office complexes, tech parks, multiplexes, and commercial hubs all face the same challenge: how to accommodate increasing vehicle traffic without devoting valuable real estate to conventional parking lots.</p>
<p>Enter the <strong>Puzzle Parking System</strong> — a smart, modular, and efficient solution rapidly gaining traction among developers and urban planners. In this blog, we explore why puzzle parking is fast becoming the preferred choice for commercial spaces across India.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Understanding the Puzzle Parking System</h3>
<p>A <strong>Puzzle Parking System</strong> is a semi-automated mechanical parking solution where cars are parked and retrieved using a combination of horizontal and vertical movements. As the name suggests, it functions like a puzzle grid. The cars are placed on platforms that can slide left, right, up, or down to create a vacant space for the car to be driven in or out.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional parking, puzzle systems do not require ramps or extensive driveways. They optimize vertical and horizontal space to maximize the number of vehicles that can be stored in a compact footprint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why Commercial Spaces Love Puzzle Parking</h3>
<h4>1. <strong>Space Optimization in Prime Real Estate</strong></h4>
<p>Commercial properties are all about maximizing usable space. Puzzle parking systems allow developers to accommodate up to three times more vehicles in the same area compared to conventional parking layouts. This is especially beneficial in city centers where every square foot counts.</p>
<h4>2. <strong>Higher Turnover Efficiency</strong></h4>
<p>Unlike fully automated systems, puzzle parking doesn’t require long retrieval times. Vehicles can be parked or retrieved simultaneously on different levels, reducing waiting time and enabling faster turnover during peak hours. This is particularly crucial for shopping malls, corporate campuses, and multiplexes.</p>
<h4>3. <strong>Scalability and Modularity</strong></h4>
<p>Puzzle systems are modular and can be scaled according to the project’s needs. Whether it’s a compact 3&#215;3 unit for a boutique office or a large-scale 6&#215;6 matrix for a commercial tower, the system can be customized and expanded as required.</p>
<h4>4. <strong>Aesthetic &amp; Space-Saving Design</strong></h4>
<p>Modern puzzle parking systems are sleek and can be integrated within basements, podiums, or standalone structures. This helps maintain the visual appeal of commercial architecture while reducing the building&#8217;s footprint.</p>
<h4>5. <strong>Reduced Operational Costs</strong></h4>
<p>Semi-automated puzzle systems consume far less energy than fully automated parking towers. They also have fewer moving parts, which translates to lower maintenance costs and downtime. When paired with a 24&#215;7 AMC service like that offered by City Park, reliability becomes a strong selling point.</p>
<h4>6. <strong>User-Friendly and Low Training Required</strong></h4>
<p>Puzzle systems are easy to operate with minimal staff training. This makes them suitable for commercial venues where high staff turnover can be a challenge. With touch-screen kiosks, RFID integration, or mobile apps, the user interface is intuitive for both operators and drivers.</p>
<h4>7. <strong>Enhanced Safety and Security</strong></h4>
<p>Vehicles parked in a puzzle system are not accessible to the public, reducing risks of theft, damage, or vandalism. With CCTV, RFID, and entry/exit logs, the security of commercial premises is greatly enhanced.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Where Puzzle Parking Works Best in Commercial Environments</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shopping Malls &amp; Retail Complexes</strong>: Peak-hour congestion can be mitigated with faster parking and retrieval.</li>
<li><strong>IT &amp; Business Parks</strong>: Employees benefit from secure and quick parking access.</li>
<li><strong>Multiplexes &amp; Entertainment Zones</strong>: Multiple car movement simultaneously handles show-time rush.</li>
<li><strong>Airports &amp; Railway Stations</strong>: Puzzle parking is an ideal fit for transit hubs with short-duration parking needs.</li>
<li><strong>Convention Centers &amp; Hotels</strong>: Adds sophistication to guest experience and supports valet services.</li>
</ul>

<p>These examples showcase that APS is not just a metro-centric trend but a pan-India necessity.</p>
<p><strong>Government Policies &amp; Incentives</strong></p>
<p>The central and state governments have rolled out various policies to support APS adoption:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FAR Incentives:</strong> Some urban local bodies offer additional Floor Area Ratio (FAR) if developers include APS in their plans.</li>
<li><strong>Smart City Grants:</strong> Cities under the Smart Cities Mission can use allocated funds to invest in APS as part of their mobility plans.</li>
<li><strong>Public-Private Partnerships (PPP):</strong> State authorities are inviting private players to implement and operate APS in public places.</li>
</ul>
<p>These initiatives make the integration of APS not only viable but also economically rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges: Awareness, Cost, Urban Planning</strong></p>
<p>Despite its benefits, APS adoption in Tier 2 cities faces hurdles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Awareness:</strong> Many builders and urban planners are still unfamiliar with the operational and financial advantages of APS.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Investment:</strong> The upfront cost can be a deterrent, though the long-term ROI is favorable.</li>
<li><strong>Urban Planning Limitations:</strong> In some cases, zoning regulations and outdated building codes hinder APS deployment.</li>
</ul>
<p>To overcome these, a multi-pronged approach involving stakeholder education, government incentives, and revised regulations is essential.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Innovations Enabling Scalable Solutions</strong></p>
<p>Advanced automation technologies are making APS more reliable, user-friendly, and scalable:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can Automated Parking Systems Make Indian Malls &amp; Hospitals More Efficient?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction: Parking Chaos in High-Footfall Areas</strong></p>
<p>Urban India is in the midst of a mobility crisis, not just on roads but also in how we manage space for stationary vehicles. Nowhere is this more visible than at high-footfall destinations like shopping malls, hospitals, and airports. Visitors to these places often spend more time looking for parking than on the services or shopping they came for. With India adding nearly 2.5 million cars annually and commercial developments sprouting across cities, the need for smarter parking solutions has never been more urgent.</p>
<p><strong><u>Enter Automated Parking Systems (APS).</u></strong></p>
<p>Automated Parking Systems are revolutionizing how space is utilized in dense urban environments. From increasing parking capacity to reducing user frustration, APS is redefining how India parks. But the question remains: can they truly enhance operational efficiency in malls and hospitals?</p>
<p>The answer is a resounding yes.</p>
<p><strong>Impact on User Experience &amp; Customer Retention</strong></p>
<p>First impressions matter. In a hyper-competitive market where every customer counts, the parking experience can make or break a brand. Imagine driving into a mall on a weekend or a hospital during peak visiting hours. The chaos, the honking, the circling around to find a vacant spot, and then remembering where you parked—these are pain points familiar to most urban Indians.</p>
<p>With an APS, this process becomes seamless. Drivers leave their vehicles at a designated drop-off point. The system takes over, automatically parking the car in a compact vertical or horizontal storage space. No stress. No waste of time. No risk of damage. This smooth experience translates to increased customer satisfaction and improved retention.</p>
<p><strong>Managing High Turnover with Limited Space</strong></p>
<p>Hospitals and malls face a unique parking challenge: extremely high turnover with highly unpredictable peak hours. APS provides a scalable and modular solution. A system designed to accommodate 100 cars can be expanded to 150 or even 200 by adding extra vertical or horizontal modules—without increasing the building footprint.</p>
<p>This flexibility is key in managing demand surges during weekends, holidays, or medical emergencies. APS also reduces the time it takes to retrieve a vehicle, improving traffic circulation and ensuring quicker turnaround.</p>
<p>For hospitals, this also means faster movement of patients and caregivers. For malls, more cars mean more shoppers and more revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Real-World Examples in India</strong></p>
<p>Several Indian commercial establishments are already reaping the benefits of APS.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phoenix Marketcity, Mumbai</strong> has integrated a semi-automated parking system to handle weekend crowds.</li>
<li><strong>Apollo Hospitals, Chennai</strong> has implemented APS to improve emergency accessibility.</li>
<li><strong>Bangalore International Airport</strong> is testing automated valet and robotic parking pilots to streamline parking.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few examples where smart parking isn&#8217;t just a luxury but a necessity.</p>
<p><strong>Return on Investment for Property Owners</strong></p>
<p>APS may involve a higher initial capital outlay, but the long-term returns are substantial. Here’s how:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Space Utilization</strong>: Up to 60% more cars can be parked in the same area.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Optimization</strong>: With higher throughput and lower wait time, APS leads to more transactions and higher parking revenues.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Manpower Costs</strong>: Automation cuts down the need for attendants and valet services.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Property Value</strong>: High-end technology adds to the overall valuation of the property.</li>
</ul>
<p>For builders and commercial property developers, APS isn&#8217;t just a feature—it&#8217;s an investment that pays off in customer loyalty, operational efficiency, and asset appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance &amp; Safety Considerations</strong></p>
<p>APS systems are highly engineered solutions and require regular upkeep to ensure seamless operation. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodic software upgrades</li>
<li>Mechanical part inspections</li>
<li>Emergency power backups</li>
<li>Fire safety and ventilation systems</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where City Park&#8217;s role becomes crucial. With a legacy since 2007, City Park offers not just installation but 24x7x365 Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMCs) that ensure your system never goes offline. Our strategic partnerships with international vendors ensure your system is backed by global standards and local support.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: APS as a Value-Driver for Commercial Real Estate</strong></p>

<p><strong>Introduction: The Chaos of Urban Parking in Indian Metros</strong></p>
<p>India’s rapid urbanization has been a double-edged sword. While it has fueled economic growth and development, it has also led to an unprecedented surge in vehicle ownership. Cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore are bursting at the seams with traffic, and finding a parking spot has become an everyday struggle. Streets are often cluttered with haphazardly parked vehicles, leading to congestion, pollution, and frustration. In such a landscape, the need for innovative parking solutions is not just urgent—it&#8217;s inevitable.</p>
<p>Enter the <strong>Automated Car Parking System (ACPS)</strong>, a technology-driven solution that is redefining urban infrastructure by streamlining parking operations, maximizing space utilization, and enhancing commuter convenience.</p>
<p><strong>The Concept of Automated Car Parking System</strong></p>
<p>Automated Car Parking Systems are mechanical systems designed to minimize the area and/or volume required for parking cars. They function much like a multi-level storage rack. The driver simply parks the car on a platform, and the system automatically moves the vehicle to an available parking slot using lifts, conveyors, shuttles, or turntables.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional parking, ACPS eliminates the need for ramps, driveways, and large parking attendants, significantly reducing land usage while increasing the number of cars that can be parked in a given area.</p>
<p>These systems come in various types—tower parking, puzzle parking, rotary parking, and stack parking—each catering to specific urban layouts and capacities.</p>
<p><strong>Role of Automated Car Parking Systems in Urban Mobility</strong></p>
<p>With urban land becoming more expensive and limited, ACPS plays a pivotal role in maximizing space in residential complexes, commercial hubs, malls, airports, and metro stations. They enhance efficiency by reducing the time spent by drivers in searching for parking.</p>
<p>For city planners and developers, automated parking means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better space management</li>
<li>Integration with smart city infrastructure</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In cities where every square meter counts, the demand for smarter parking solutions has never been higher. That&#8217;s where the automatic car parking system comes in. This modern solution doesn&#8217;t just save space—it changes how we think about parking itself. No more endless circling, no more squeezing into tight spots. With the rise of smart technologies and automated systems, parking is becoming faster, safer, and far more efficient.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is an Automatic Car Parking System?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its core, an automatic car parking system is designed to minimize human involvement in the parking process. The driver simply positions the car at a designated entry point. From there, machines take over. Whether it’s through lifts, platforms, or shuttles, the vehicle is moved into an available space and parked with precision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike traditional parking lots that waste space on ramps and wide lanes, these systems utilize vertical and horizontal space more effectively. That means more cars in less area, which is critical in high-density urban zones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An automatic parking system is often confused with smart or robotic parking systems. Here&#8217;s how they differ:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Automatic Parking System (APS):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fully or semi-automated, these systems require minimal human input once the car is in the entry bay.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Smart Parking System:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Typically refers to IoT-powered solutions that guide drivers to available spots using sensors and real-time data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Robotic Parking System:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Uses robotic shuttles or dollies to transport and position cars, often without any need for ramps or lanes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each type caters to specific needs and infrastructure limitations, and choosing the right one depends on budget, land availability, and user experience goals.</span></p>
<h2><b>How Does an Automatic Car Parking System Work?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The operation of these systems blends engineering precision with intelligent automation. Here’s what happens behind the scenes:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The driver enters the car into a designated transfer area.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensors analyze the size and positioning of the vehicle.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A conveyor, lift, or robotic shuttle picks up the vehicle.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system transports and places the vehicle into an available slot, often in a multi-level or underground structure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the car is needed again, the retrieval process is triggered either through a panel or mobile app.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s seamless, intuitive, and significantly faster than traditional parking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider tower parking systems, where cars are stacked vertically using a central elevator. This setup is ideal for areas with very limited land but high parking demand.</span></p>
<h2><b>Types of Car Parking Systems Explained</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the infrastructure and user requirements, there are several types of automatic parking systems available today.</span></p>
<p><b>Fully Automatic Car Parking Systems</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> require no human intervention once the car is placed in the bay. These systems handle everything from transport to slotting and retrieval using robotic lifts or shuttles. They&#8217;re ideal for commercial properties or high-end residential buildings where space optimization and premium experience are priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, </span><b>Semi-Automatic Car Parking Systems</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> still rely partially on human input. Drivers may need to navigate their car to specific platforms, after which the system takes over. These systems are more cost-effective and suited to medium-density projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there are </span><b>Smart Car Parking Systems</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which are more about guidance than automation. Using sensors and cloud-based platforms, they provide real-time updates about space availability and direct drivers efficiently.</span></p>
<p><b>Car Lift Parking Systems</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer a straightforward way to double parking capacity in tight spots. Think of mechanical lifts used in basements or smaller buildings where a full-scale APS isn&#8217;t viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, </span><a href="https://citypark.co.in/product/puzzle-parking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Puzzle Parking Systems</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer flexible multi-level parking using shifting platforms, while </span><a href="https://citypark.co.in/product/tower-parking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Tower Parking Systems</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use vertical stacking to accommodate dozens of vehicles in the footprint of just a few.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each type serves a different use case, making it possible to find a solution for nearly any scenario, from commercial towers to residential blocks.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key Components That Power These Systems</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The efficiency of an automatic parking system depends entirely on its components. Here&#8217;s what typically keeps things running smoothly:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Hydraulic or Electric Lifts:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These lift vehicles between levels. Hydraulic lifts are favored for their smooth operation and low maintenance, while electric ones offer more precise control.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Conveyor Platforms:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These move cars horizontally into slots, commonly used in puzzle and tower parking.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Central Control System:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A programmable logic controller (PLC) or computer governs the movement and allocation logic.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sensors &amp; Detectors:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> From vehicle detection to height and width measurement, sensors ensure the car is parked without a scratch.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>RFID &amp; Access Cards:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For secure retrieval and user authentication.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each component plays a role in ensuring the entire system operates safely, quickly, and reliably.</span></p>
<h2><b>What Makes These Systems a Smart Investment</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For developers, planners, and even homeowners, investing in an automatic car parking system brings tangible advantages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it’s about space. Conventional parking often requires twice the land compared to an automatic system. With automated stacking and optimized layouts, parking lots can handle up to 60% more vehicles in the same area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there&#8217;s time. Users can park or retrieve their cars in under 120 seconds. This significantly reduces waiting time, especially in office complexes or malls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is another major benefit. Limited access to parked cars prevents theft and accidental damage. In many systems, the user is not even allowed into the parking zone, reducing liability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From an environmental standpoint, automated systems lead to reduced vehicle idling. This means lower fuel consumption and fewer emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operationally, there are fewer staff needed, and lighting or HVAC needs are minimal in these tightly controlled environments.</span></p>
<h2><b>Disadvantages You Should Be Aware Of</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No system is perfect. Automatic car parking systems, while highly efficient, do come with certain limitations.</span></p>
<p><b>Cost is the most obvious one.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Installing a fully robotic system can cost significantly more upfront than building a traditional parking lot. This includes civil work, machinery, automation, and software.</span></p>
<p><b>Maintenance is ongoing.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With moving parts, electronics, and software, regular checks and servicing are non-negotiable.</span></p>
<p><b>Power dependency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also a concern. If the system is down due to a power outage or a software failure, vehicle retrieval can be delayed unless there are robust backup mechanisms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, most modern systems come with redundancies and manual overrides to mitigate these issues.</span></p>
<h2><b>How Much Do Robotic and Smart Parking Systems Cost in India?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pricing varies widely based on system type, scale, and customization. Here’s a general guide:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Basic car lift systems:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ₹5–10 lakhs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Puzzle parking systems:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ₹12–20 lakhs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tower parking systems:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ₹20–40 lakhs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Fully robotic systems:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ₹50 lakhs and up</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final cost depends on factors such as the number of slots, height of the structure, land condition, and tech features like RFID access or mobile app integration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Mumbai, a fully automated parking tower for commercial buildings can reach costs upward of ₹70 lakhs, while semi-automatic solutions for residential societies are more modest.</span></p>
<h2><b>Smart Parking in Action Across India</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growing need for structured and intelligent parking is being met by real implementations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><b>residential societies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, puzzle parking and car lift systems are common. They&#8217;re affordable and fit into limited basement spaces without the need for complex infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><b>Commercial spaces and malls</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increasingly opt for tower or robotic systems to manage high vehicle volume with minimal staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><b>airports and metro stations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, smart parking systems help reduce entry and exit congestion. Digital signboards, app-based payments, and license plate recognition are now commonplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noteworthy implementations include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mumbai&#8217;s BMC tower parking project at Marine Drive</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delhi Metro&#8217;s integration of parking with Metro smart cards</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These examples show how automatic car parking systems are no longer futuristic but are actively solving problems in India&#8217;s largest cities.</span></p>
<h2><b>Real-Time Smart Parking: How It Actually Works</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart parking isn&#8217;t just about automation; it’s about real-time information. These systems often rely on a network of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>IoT sensors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> installed in parking spots to detect vehicle presence</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Wireless communication</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to transmit data to a central server</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cloud-based software</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that aggregates data and updates availability</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>User-facing mobile apps</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that show users where to go</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a vehicle enters the facility, the system guides it to the nearest available slot. In commercial lots, the system also handles ticketing and payments digitally.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">The automated parking system involves a high level of automation for fast, efficient and reliable parking. There are different types of smart parking systems available, so finding the specific and most suited parking system might be quite difficult. The most common problem that every driver&#8217;s face it, finding a parking system in their day to day life. This system chooses the nearest free car park for the car and mechanically slots the car into that space. Here are some factors that you need to consider when selecting automated car parking for residential and corporates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">When finding the automated car parking system, accuracy is the important thing. Parking guidance is loved by most people, when they see a green bay availability indicator light above occupied parking bays, their experience quickly turns sour. Indicator lighting and other parking guidance signs need to proper and updating in real-time.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">The lack of accuracy serves to create more complaints and waste the time of your asset managers. You have to look for update frequency, reporting and notification features of any system to ensure that the data supplied is going to be of use to improves and manage your operations effectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Ask the right questions</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">There are various ways to solve your problem, so you have to ask the right question to select the best one. You can have various questions like about their local and national install bases, like how they handle service and warranty repairs. Whether they established local staff, who can respond quickly? Type of system they use and a lot more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>The adaptability of the system</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"> You should also check the system&#8217;s adaptability because the rapidly evolving technology of the system will become outdated very quickly. So it is advisable to prefer an advanced model based on the latest technology to prevent the need to switch the system in the future. Also, select the system with all possible features that are capable enough to adapt to the changes in technology. And check whether the system allows upgrading with the latest software solutions to enhance its features and functionality.</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">When selecting the parking system, you have to make sure the equipment that is being installed in your asset is up to date. The equipment should be the one that is reliable and robust. An automated car parking system is generally in operation every day, and it is situated in an environment that demands durability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Maintenance</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">To make your investment effective, you have to look over the maintenance programs of your provider. It requires to make sure ongoing functionality and smooth operations. It also helps to ensure that your investment will be looked after for at least five years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">The main factor that you need to look for is user friendliness that is how easy your system will be to use. The part of convenience goes for both the operator and the customers. The car parking system should have all the required features and visual indications to make it easy for the drivers to locate empty spaces and to get their vehicles in and out of the facilities.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">On the other hand, when focusing on simplicity, you should also ensure the system you choose to have all the features that make it secure for the staff and customers using it. The management system should be effective for the best user experience. The system should have an easy and quick check-in and check-out time to reduce the customers&#8217; time to wait in line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Customisation</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">For each location, time variant availability, specialty bays, the combination of commercial and residential parking areas are different. Not all parking is the same, so if your parking has a specific or unique requirement, it is essential to make sure that you have flexible and dynamic signs capabilities. In addition, you should also make sure that your parking guidance system can be customised and easily tailored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Signage </strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">An automated car parking system without the best way-finding signage is definitely going to be a poor investment choice. Also, make sure that the signage installed is sufficient to make the way-finding. The customer should experience a stress free and smooth parking experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Installation</strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">In determining the priority of your management system, you need to check the location. The location of your parking system plays a vital role. For instance, a parking system located in the residential area will serve various needs than the one located in a busy commercial hub. And the management system that suits for these locations will also vary. That is, the management system should be able to adjust to cater for rapid peak and off-peak changes for the commercial hub.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">The location of the parking should also have the ability to monitor and streamline the local traffic to plan for the availability of parking spaces. You might need a system that can reserve space for regulars for the residential car park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Ground sensors</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">These types of sensors can be placed in or on the ground at each of the parking bays and transmit occupancy information from each bay to the gateway/base station in real time using a wireless transmission protocol. These sensors provide completely autonomous operation and no need for conduits, wires, electricity etc.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">It will result in significant cost savings on this supporting infrastructure and provide a clean and minimalistic look for the solution with only compact sensors. To identify vehicle presence, these sensors also use one or more of detection sensors, such as magnetometers, various radars and light Sensors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Cameras </strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">You have to look for cameras to identify vehicles location and License Plate Recognition (LPR) technology to identify and read the license plate number. It has its own benefits, especially if you need to monitor large and open spaces. All you required is one camera with LPR at the entrance and the exit of a garage to identify whether a particular car has entered or left the garage based on its license plate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Check the experience of the supplier</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">When selecting the automated car parking system, you have to check the suppliers training on how to use the system. Even though the system is easy to install and automated, the people there should be trained on one or two things about the parking system. This will give the knowledge on how to manage the parking system for better services, and the most parking system doesn&#8217;t require frequent maintenance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Features of the parking system</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">Consider the feature of the parking system, which will vary from another system. Therefore you have to ensure that you detect the features that you give first priority. Automated car parking is the best for you since your parkers will be able to choose their parking using their license, parking lot, car number plates and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Safety</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">Safety is the most important thing that you have to consider when selecting the best automated car parking system.

<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">This system allows developers to save on construction costs through reduced excavation, reduced construction time and lower land costs. Due to the reduced requirement of only two air changes per hour for automated parking systems, minimum ventilation costs is achievable. In an automated parking system, lighting costs are insignificant, which can also provide significant cost savings. Since cars are being stored within a locked garage with no access to users or unauthorized personnel, low insurance premiums are achievable. It also makes it virtually impossible to vandalize or steal from the cars stored within the garage.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Decrease environmental impact</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">People who have driven through public parking might know how time-consuming and difficult to find an open parking space. Open parking has an environmental impact that comes in the form of continuous exhaust emissions. It also increases customer satisfaction and makes a comfortable and memorable user experience that they will be willing to pay for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Summing it up</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;">The above mentioned are some of the factors that you have to consider and think of when selecting automated car parking for residential and corporates.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b>Why City Park&#8217;s Car Bot Parking is the Future?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"> With the increase in the amount of cars and vehicles that are being manufactured and used by people. An efficient method of parking system is required. However, relaxing when you escape the traffic is often a predominant<br />
factor in big and busy cities. There comes another headache following the traffic, which is finding a safe parking lot. You cannot park your car anywhere you want. There are a lot of times where the car can get damaged. You should<br />
also not park your vehicle at an NO PARKING area so that you escape from fine and legal issues. Would you please continue scrolling to have a deeper dive into the efficient method of parking?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b>What is an Automated Parking System (APS)?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"> It is a famous quote that states, &#8220;Necessity is the mother of invention&#8221;. Yes, it is true because, when people and industries found out the necessity of parking lots that are arising in this world, they created an APS. The automated parking system, also called APS, is a mechanically designed system that helps people in parking their vehicles in a safe and within a small amount of area. An APS racks the cars on top of each other in an efficient manner, which helps in the ease of parking within a minimum number of areas and volume that is required. It was also profitable because it helped people in parking a greater number of vehicles that they were able to park in a normal parking garage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b>What are the major types of APS upon function?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"> APS helped in automatically parking and retrieving the cars or vehicles in an efficient manner. There are two major types of APS that are available for people&#8217;s convenience. They are:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="disc">
<li style="color: #0e101a; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;">Fully-automated APS</li>
<li style="color: #0e101a; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;">Semi-automated APS</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b>Fully-automated APS</b>: It has become one of the most sophisticated types of parking system. It is basically a robot vented model, and all that you have to do is just take your car to the entry point of APS. You can take the ticket<br />
or code that is automatically provided to you. The driver and other passengers have to vacate the car. This automated parking system identifies the size of the car and its dimensions using a proximity sensor. This helps the APS to park the vehicle in the perfect empty parking slot. After people have vacated the car, the APS lifts your car and parks at the specified place. After this, the people can safely park their vehicles. Upon returning, you have to provide the ticket or the code you received during parking, and the APS lands back your vehicle safely.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b>Semi-automated APS</b>: Unlike the fully automated parking system, in a semi-automated parking system, a small help is required. In the fully-automated APS, the machine was developed in a way that the entire process can be done by<br />
itself, and there is no need for any kind of assistance. But in the semi-automated system, assistance is required for parking the vehicle in the allotted empty parking slot.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b>Different types of parking at the city park</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">Though the APS was classified into two major types based on its functionality, there are many different types of parking lots that the city park provides its customers. These parking slots are different from each other and have their own advantages. The types of parking slots available at city<br />
park are:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="disc">
<li style="color: #0e101a; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;">Puzzle parking</li>
<li style="color: #0e101a; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;">Tower parking</li>
<li style="color: #0e101a; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;">Translator parking</li>
<li style="color: #0e101a; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;">Cart parking</li>
<li style="color: #0e101a; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;">Car bot parking</li>
<li style="color: #0e101a; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;">Rotatory parking</li>
</ul>
